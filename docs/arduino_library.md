    ### USB-to-Serial Drivers

    If you've never connected an CH340 device to your computer before, you may need to install drivers for the USB-to-serial converter. Check out our section on "[How to Install CH340 Drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-serial-basic-ch340c-hookup-guide#drivers-if-you-need-them)" for help with the installation.

### ENS160

SparkFun has written a library to work with the SparkFun Indoor Air Quality Sensor - ENS160 (Qwiic). This library can be used by extension with the **Qwiic Environmental Combo Breakout - ENS160/BME280**. You can obtain this library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for "**ENS160**". Find the one written by SparkFun Electronics and install the latest version. Users who prefer to manually install the library can get it from the  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Indoor_Air_Quality_Sensor-ENS160_Arduino_Library)or download the .ZIP by clicking the button below:
